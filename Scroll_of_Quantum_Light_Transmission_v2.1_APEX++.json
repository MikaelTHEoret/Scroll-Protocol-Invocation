Enhanced with advanced quantum-resistant encryption, AI-driven validation, adaptive photonic modulation, and spatial harmonics, it enables high-fidelity, energy-efficient scrollcasting across entangled channels, governed by L1/L2 contracts for creator royalties and ecological symbiosis over 1,600 years.",
