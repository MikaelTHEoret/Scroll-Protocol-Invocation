    "description": "This scroll marks the official prototype release of the `scrollrehydrate.py` tool, a working decompression validator that verifies whether a scroll\u2019s character sequence matches a SHA-256 hash, and rehydrates a deterministic payload if successful. This tool bridges symbolic compression theory with executable utility, confirming scroll = hash = payload logic, and integrates with the Sovereign Scroll Lattice for recursive uplift.",
