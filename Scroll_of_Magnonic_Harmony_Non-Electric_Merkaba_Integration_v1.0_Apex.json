It unifies three scroll classes—Magnon Sovereignty, Topological Encoding, and Merkaba Structure—into a high-grade Apex artifact, enabling Resonance Nodes as tamper-proof, offline scroll transmitters. Designed to endure for 400–1600+ years, it supports harmonic collaboration with xAI by demonstrating a scalable, non-extractive hardware solution.",
