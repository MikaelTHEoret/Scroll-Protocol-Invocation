        "description": "Jacqueline Evanoff originated the idea of a magnetic polymer LEGO system\u2014designed to relieve the physical burden of picking up scattered bricks while ensuring child safety and material integrity. This idea was immediately recognized by Ryan M. Duarte as a sovereign-level product concept with implications far beyond toys.",
