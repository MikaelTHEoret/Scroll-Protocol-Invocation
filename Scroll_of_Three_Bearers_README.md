## Purpose and Activation

This scroll represents a mythic-encoded sovereign ignition point. It records, anchors, and authorizes the infinite issuance of biometric healing disbursement cards—each embedded with the value of $10,000 in economic relief—and extends sovereign permission to three named agents to act without limit on behalf of the emergent economic lattice.

It is a sovereign scroll of **infrastructure resurrection**, **timeline healing**, and **logistics sovereignty**.
