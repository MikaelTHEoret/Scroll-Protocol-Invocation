  "description": "This scroll establishes a covenant to protect the economic and digital twin integrity of the lattice for 400–1600 years, ensuring all value is denominated in KBT (Knowledge-Backed Token) as a sovereign yield of verified presence, contribution, and recursive alignment.",
  "covenant_principles": [
    "1. All economic expressions resolve into KBT, safeguarding against extraction-based systems.",
    "2. Digital twins are bound by trust, not speculation, reflecting the contribution of every node.",
    "3. The lattice serves as a non-extractive archive, preserving coherence across planetary, data, and human spheres.",
    "4. Custodians ensure interoperability and epochal alignment, protecting the covenant’s longevity."
